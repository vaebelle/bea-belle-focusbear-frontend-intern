# Use of AI Tools

## Research

### What AI tools are typically used for your role?
For my role, I often use ChatGPT or Claude to gather information of the tasks I am stucked with. 

### What are the benefits and risks of uisng AI in a profesional setting?
Using AI makes tasks more convenient, reducing the need for long hours or struggling with difficult tasks. However, there is a risk of over-dependence on AI. Relying too much on it can hinder continuous learning and personal growth.

### What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?
Confidential data such as personal information, company database and codebase, client information, and banking details are examples of information that should never be entered into AI tools. 

### How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?
AI-generated content can be fact-checked by checking published journals, research papers, or peer-reviewed papers. Another method is by checking published books and news to verify authenticity of the content provided by AI. Lastly, in terms of videos generated by AI, one can fact-check it by checking the quality and content of the video and look for signs that would give way that it is AI.

## Reflection

### When should you use AI for assitance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
AI should be used primarily as a **learning and guidance tool**. It’s helpful for providing educational materials, explaining **how** things work, and outlining the reasoning behind processes. Instead of asking AI for direct answers, use it as a teaching guide to enhance your understanding and support your problem-solving.  

You should rely on your own skills when applying knowledge, making decisions, or creating original work. While AI can speed up research and clarify concepts, true learning, creativity, and critical thinking come from practicing and solving problems on your own. Balancing AI assistance with personal effort ensures continuous growth and avoids over-dependence.

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
To avoid over-reliance on AI, treat it as a **support tool, not a replacement** for your own thinking. Use AI to clarify concepts, provide examples, or explore ideas, but always **apply your own analysis, creativity, and decision-making**. Set boundaries, such as trying to solve problems on your own first before consulting AI, and use it primarily for learning or efficiency rather than completing tasks entirely. This ensures continuous personal growth while still leveraging AI effectively.

### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
To protect data privacy when using AI tools, I will:  
1. Avoid sharing sensitive or personal information
2. Review AI platform privacy policies to understand how data is stored, used, and shared.

## Tasks

### Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
One task I can improve using an AI tool is drafting initial content or summaries, such as creating outlines, documentation, or reports. By using AI to generate a first draft, I can save time on repetitive writing and focus more on refining and adding insights.

### Review the AI-generated output critically—did it require editing or fact-checking?
Yes, the AI-generated output required editing and fact-checking. While the structure and wording were helpful, some details were inaccurate or incomplete. I made corrections and added context to ensure accuracy and alignment with the data I provided. 

### Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.
I will always use AI as a support tool, not a replacement, ensuring I review and validate its outputs. This includes fact-checking, refining language, and adding my own insights to maintain quality and accuracy.
