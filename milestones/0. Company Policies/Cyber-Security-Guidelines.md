# Cyber Security

## Research

### What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?
Common cybersecurity threats in a remote work environment include:  
- Phishing attacks: Fake emails or messages that trick you into sharing sensitive information.  
- Malware and ransomware: Malicious software that can steal data or lock your files.  
- Unsecured Wi-Fi networks: Public or poorly secured networks can allow attackers to intercept data.  
- Weak passwords: Easily guessed or reused passwords increase the risk of account compromise.

### What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?
- Keep your operating system, apps, and antivirus software up to date.  
- Use strong, unique passwords for each account.  
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.  
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive work tasks or use a trusted VPN.  
- Regularly backup important files to a secure location.  
- Be cautious when clicking links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.  


### Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?
Locking your computer prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information, protects personal and company data, and reduces the risk of accidental or intentional data breaches. Even a short moment of unattended access can lead to compromised accounts or confidential information exposure.  

### How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?
- Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources.  
- Verify the sender before responding or providing any information.  
- Report phishing attempts to your IT or security team.  
- Use official channels to confirm any unusual requests for sensitive information.  

### What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?
A strong password:  
- Is at least 12–16 characters long 
- Includes a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols  
- Does not reuse passwords across multiple accounts  
A password manager helps by securely storing and generating strong, unique passwords for all accounts, reducing the risk of breaches due to weak or reused passwords.  


### Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?
Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security beyond your password by requiring a second verification method. It should be enabled on all accounts that support it, especially for email, cloud storage, and financial platforms, to protect against unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

## Reflection

### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
I currently follow several security measures, including using strong, unique passwords, keeping my devices up to date, and locking my computer when away from my desk. I also try to verify emails and links before clicking.  
Areas for improvement include consistently using two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts (I honestly find this a hassle, but I am trying) and being more diligent about avoiding public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks.

### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
Secure behavior becomes a habit by integrating it into daily routines. This includes always locking devices, regularly updating software, using a password manager, and double-checking emails before clicking links. 

### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for each account.  
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) if possible.  
- Regularly review and update passwords for critical accounts.  
- Avoid sharing passwords or sensitive account details with others.  
- Be cautious of phishing attempts and suspicious links that could compromise credentials.

### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
If I suspected a security breach, I would:  
1. Immediately change my password and enable 2FA if not already active.  
2. Disconnect the affected device from the internet if needed.  
3. Check for unauthorized activity on accounts and notify relevant contacts if necessary.  
4. Monitor accounts for further unusual activity and follow recommended recovery steps.

My device is configured already to lock when I am idle. This results me to input my password again to access my device.
