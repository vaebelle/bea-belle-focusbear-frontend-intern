## Best Practices for Handling Confidential Data:

4. Access data only when necessary and when authorized.

## Actions towards a suspected data breach or accidental disclosure of confidential information:
1. Stop the breach if possible by changing passwords and revoking access.
2. Report to higher-ups about the breach and report every information I am aware of.
3. Document every log and include this in the report.

## Steps I can do to ensure I handle data securely in my daily tasks:
1. Never feed AI (such as ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) with sensitive and confidential information/data.
2. Make sure my files are saved securely.
3. Never use free public wifi.
4. Make passwords strong with 2-Factor Authentication Verification.
5. Be wary of phising.

## How should you store, Share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
Store sensitive information only in secure systems with limited access approved by the company, share it carefully to verified recipients and secure methods, and dispose of it properly by permanently deleting digital files according to company policies. 

## Common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues and how to avoid these mistakes: 
| Common Mistake | How to Avoid It |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Sending sensitive information to the wrong person | Double-check recipients before sending emails or files |
| Using weak or reused passwords | Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication |
| Storing data in unapproved apps or personal devices | Use only company-approved storage and systems |
| Leaving devices unlocked or unattended | Lock screens and log out when stepping away |
| Falling for phishing or suspicious links | Verify requests and avoid clicking unknown links or attachments |
| Sharing more information than necessary | Follow the “minimum necessary” principle when sharing data |
| Using public Wi-Fi for sensitive work | Use secure networks or a VPN when handling confidential data |
| Ignoring software updates | Install updates promptly to patch security vulnerabilities |
| Improper disposal of sensitive files or documents | Permanently delete digital files and shred physical documents |
| Not reporting mistakes quickly | Report incidents immediately to reduce damage |

## Habit or practice I adopt to improve data security in my role:
1. Always double check the recipients when sending sensitive data.
2. Never access data not related to my work.

## Key Learning or security measure I will implement:
I learned that sharing sensitive data without verifying recipients is a common cause of breaches, so I make sure to handle it carefully in my code. When building features (such as forms) that collect emails, habits, or survey responses, I access only necessary data via secure APIs, transmit it over HTTPS, avoid storing it insecurely on the frontend, and never expose it in logs. These practices help protect user privacy while delivering secure, functional features.
