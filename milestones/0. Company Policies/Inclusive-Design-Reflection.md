### design or communication improvement: 
Improve accessibility by including gentle, customizable reminders that break tasks into micro-steps, helping users with executive functioning start and complete tasks without feeling overwhelmed. As of using it now, there are still issues in sub-tasks options in the Windows version. 

### Response to a Hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning:
**Scenario:**
**User:** _“I open Focus Bear, but I just stare at the screen and don’t know where to start. I feel like I can’t get anything done.”_
**My Response:** _"Hey, it’s okay Buddy! I know that feeling of staring at a screen and not knowing where to start. You are not failing. Try just one tiny step, like writing your thoughts in Brain Dump or write something you want to do in the to do list. Even that small bit counts and you are already making progress."_
