# Professionalism at Focus Bear

## Examples of professional vs. unprofessional behavior in a casual work environment:
| Professional Behaviour| Unprofessional Behaviour|
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Speak respectfully, listen actively, ask thoughtful questions, and follow up on action items| Interrupting others, gossiping, asking questions without doing basic research, ignoring messages, or ghosting the project |
| Come prepared with questions or an agenda, take notes, stay engaged, and follow up on tasks| Arriving unprepared, multi-tasking, repeating questions, dominating the conversation, or sending vague calendar invites   |
| Collaborate, share updates proactively, ask for help when needed, and be receptive to feedback| Waiting for instructions, refusing to assist teammates, ignoring feedback, or relying only on one communication method    |
| Use clear, concise, polite messages; escalate appropriately depending on urgency| Sending unclear or rude emails, over-escalating minor issues, or ignoring messages|
| Take initiative, provide regular updates, solve problems before escalating, and explore solutions independently | Sitting idle, waiting to be told what to do, or coming to meetings without research or preparation|
| Maintain respect, communicate clearly, and keep the workflow efficient| Disrespecting boundaries, causing distractions, or being disengaged despite the casual environment|

## Respectful communication in remote teams:
| Aspect| Best Practices|
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Tone in Messages| Use polite and professional language, avoid sarcasm or jokes that could be misinterpreted, be clear and concise|
| Handling Disagreements| Focus on the issue, not the person; acknowledge others' points; use private messages or calls for sensitive topics|
| Responding to Feedback| Respond professionally and gratefully; ask clarifying questions; avoid defensiveness; follow up with actions|
| Task Management| Reply in a timely manner; use appropriate communication channels; organize communication clearly; assume good intent|

## Ways to give and receive feedback professionally:
| Aspect| Ways|
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Giving Feedback| Talk about what someone did, not who they are; be clear with examples; suggest improvements politely; assume they mean well; give feedback privately for sensitive topics |
| Receiving Feedback| Listen carefully; stay calm and don’t get defensive; ask questions if you don’t understand; say thank you; try to use the feedback and show progress                      |

## Reflection
### Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
Yes, I have experienced great teamwork and professionalism. Durint these kinds of experience, I came to a conclusion that when there is active communication and respect between the leader and its member, it is high likely that the team would succeed and avoid any misunderstandings throughout the accomplishment of the task. Moroever, being empathetic and being ready to commit to the task as a leader or a member greatly contributes to this kind of synergy.

Clear, respectful, and inclusive communication requires sharing information in a structured and organized manner. It also means treating everyone fairly, avoiding bias, and maintaining a calm tone to create a welcoming environment where all voices are heard.

I can create a positive environment by treating everyone with respect, communicating clearly, staying supportive, sharing ideas, and balancing friendliness with professionalism.

### How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when you ld you escalate?
I follow up politely if there’s no response, using the appropriate channel based on urgency: email for general requests, chat for medium-priority, SMS for urgent, and calls for emergencies. I escalate only after waiting a reasonable time and explaining why it’s urgent.


## What are some things you won't do?
I won’t ignore messages or deadlines, skip meetings, gossip, react defensively to feedback, rely on only one communication method for urgent matters, or repeat mistakes without learning.
