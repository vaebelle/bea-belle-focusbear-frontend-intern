## Research
A **“User Manual for Me”** is a personal guide that helps others understand how you work best, communicate, and collaborate. Think of it like a manual for a product—but instead of instructions for a device, it explains **you**: your preferences, habits, strengths, and triggers.  
Teams use them because they:  
- **Reduce misunderstandings:** Everyone knows how you like to receive feedback, handle tasks, or make decisions.  
- **Improve collaboration:** Helps teammates communicate effectively and align expectations.  
- **Highlight strengths:** Shows what you bring to the table so teams can leverage your capabilities as a person.
- **Support inclusion:** Encourages openness about working styles, boundaries, and preferences, creating a healthier team environment.  


### What categories are helpful to include?
1. **Communication style:**  
   - How you prefer to receive feedback 
   - How you like to give updates or share ideas  

2. **Work style / Productivity:**  
   - Whether you thrive under deadlines or flexible schedules  
   - If you focus best alone or in collaborative sessions  
   - How you organize and prioritize tasks  

3. **Decision-making & problem-solving:**  
   - How you approach decisions 
   - How you handle challenges or pressure  

4. **Motivation & recognition:**  
   - What energizes you or keeps you engaged  
   - How you like to be recognized for good work  

5. **Boundaries & preferences:**  
   - Work hours or availability  
   - Communication boundaries 

6. **Personality quirks / fun facts (optional but humanizing):**  
   - Things teammates should know to work well with you  
   - Unique habits that influence how you work  


### How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?
1. **Clarifies expectations:** Teammates know how to approach you and what to expect in communication and collaboration.  
2. **Prevents friction:** Misinterpretations of behavior or intentions decrease because you’ve shared how you operate.  
3. **Builds empathy:** Team members understand each other’s styles and challenges better.

## Reflection

### What do you need from teammates to do your best work?
In order for me to do my best work, I would appreciate that my teammates be a good communicator when relaying information or concerns about me or my work. I also appreciate if they respect my time of working, avoid disturbing me unless necessary, waiting patiently for my replies in mails, and doing their best in the work they are given to avoid delays in the team's progress. 

### How do you prefer to communicate?
When it comes to long discussions about the project, I prefer to be in a call with them to address concerns properly. If it is just quick check-ups on progress, short standup meetings or emails will do. I am also okay with messaging when talking about not so urgent/important matters. 

### What helps you stay focused and productive?
Playing music in the background helps me stay focus. Moreover, I also tend to stay focus when I am doing my work alone. If I am in a workplace with people, I stay focused as long as they do not get too noisy or disturb me in the process. An organized list of tasks also help me stay focus. 

### How do you like to give and receive feedback?
When I am giving feedback, I tend to be direct and constructive. Doing so without hurting the person I am talking to. With that, I appreciate if my teammates would do the same when they give feedbacks about me or my work. 

### What are some quirks or things to know about your work style?
I work best at my own pace. Sometimes I process ideas quickly, while other times I need a bit more time to fully think things through. This helps me ensure that my work is thorough and well-considered.
