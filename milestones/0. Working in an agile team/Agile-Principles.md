# Working in an Agile Team

## Research

### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
Agile is a flexible approach to project management that focuses on delivering work in small, continuous improvements while adapting to change. Instead of following a strict, long-term plan like traditional project management, Agile encourages collaboration, feedback, and iteration. Traditional methods tend to be more linear and plan-driven, while Agile allows teams to respond quickly to new information or shifting priorities.

### What are the core values and principles of Agile? 

The Agile Manifesto highlights four core values:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan  

These values are supported by principles that emphasize continuous delivery, teamwork, adaptability, sustainable pacing, and regular reflection to improve how teams work.

### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
Scrum organizes work into fixed-length cycles called sprints, with defined roles and ceremonies like sprint planning and reviews. It works well for teams that benefit from structured planning and regular checkpoints.

Kanban focuses on continuous workflow. Tasks move through visual stages, and teams manage work as capacity allows rather than in time-boxed cycles. It’s often used when priorities shift frequently or when teams want a more flexible, flow-based system.

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
Focus Bear leans toward Kanban because it supports continuous delivery and flexibility. Work can be prioritized easily, and tasks move based on real-time capacity rather than sprint commitments. This approach fits environments where priorities change and teams benefit from maintaining steady flow instead of rigid timelines.

## Reflection

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
The biggest benefits of Agile include adaptability, faster feedback, improved collaboration, and continuous improvement. Teams can respond quickly to change and deliver value incrementally. Challenges can include maintaining clear priorities, adapting to less rigid structure, and ensuring consistent communication. Agile requires discipline and active participation from everyone to work effectively.

### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
Agile principles encourage me to work in smaller, manageable steps, seek feedback early, and adapt when requirements change. This improves collaboration, reduces wasted effort, and helps me focus on delivering meaningful progress instead of chasing perfection all at once.

## Task

### Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.
Scrum works in set time periods called sprints, with specific roles and meetings, so the team has a predictable schedule for getting work done. Kanban is more flexible where tasks move through the workflow whenever they’re ready, based on priority and what the team can handle. Basically, Scrum focuses on planning in cycles, while Kanban focuses on keeping work flowing smoothly.

### Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.
A principle that stands out is embracing change, even late in development. Being open to adjustments helps ensure that the final product meets real needs, and it encourages flexibility and continuous learning in my day-to-day work.
