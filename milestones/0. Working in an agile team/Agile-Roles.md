# Roles in Agile Team

## Research

### What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?
- Developers  
  Developers design, build, and maintain the product. They turn requirements into working features, collaborate with other roles, and continuously improve code quality and functionality.

- QA  
  Quality Assurance (QA) ensures the product works as intended. They test features, identify bugs, verify fixes, and help maintain overall product reliability and user experience.

- Product Manager (PM)  
  The PM defines priorities and goals, manages the product backlog, and ensures the team is working on the most valuable tasks. They act as a bridge between stakeholders and the delivery team.

- Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)  
  The Agile PM supports team workflow, removes blockers, facilitates communication, and ensures Agile practices are followed. Their goal is to help the team work efficiently and continuously improve.

- Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support)  
  These roles provide valuable input and context. UX focuses on usability and design, stakeholders guide business direction, and customer support shares real-world feedback to improve the product.

### How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
In Kanban, collaboration is continuous and flow-based. Team members work together to move tasks across the board, focusing on current priorities and resolving bottlenecks as they appear. Roles tend to be flexible, with communication happening naturally as work progresses. However, in Scrum, collaboration is structured around time-boxed sprints. Roles interact through defined ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily standup, reviews, and retrospectives. Responsibilities are more explicitly defined, and teamwork centers on delivering sprint goals. Both approaches rely on strong communication, shared ownership, and cross-functional teamwork: the main difference is whether collaboration is driven by continuous flow (Kanban) or sprint cycles (Scrum).

## Reflection

### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile Process?
As a frontend developer, my role is to build and maintain the user-facing parts of the product. I translate designs and requirements into responsive, functional interfaces that provide a good user experience. In the Agile process, I contribute by delivering incremental improvements, collaborating closely with teammates, and adapting quickly to feedback or changing priorities. My work helps ensure that features are usable, visually consistent, and aligned with product goals.

### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
My responsibilities overlap with several roles in the team. I work closely with UX designers to implement designs accurately and improve usability. I collaborate with backend developers to ensure smooth data integration and functionality. I also coordinate with QA to test features and resolve issues, and with the Product Manager to clarify requirements and priorities.

## Task

### Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
As a frontend developer, my role is to turn ideas and designs into working features that users can actually interact with. I work in small steps, adjust based on feedback, and stay flexible when priorities change. This helps the team deliver useful and polished features continuously.

### Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
I often work closely with UX designers and backend developers to make sure designs are implemented correctly and feel good to use. I can improve teamwork by communicating early, asking questions when something is unclear, and sharing progress regularly. This helps us stay aligned and avoid last-minute surprises.
