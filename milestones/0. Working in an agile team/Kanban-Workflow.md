# Agile Workflows and Kanban

## Research

### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A Kanban board is an organizing tool that allows users to arrange their tasks into clear stages such as “ongoing,” “pending,” and “complete.” Tasks are represented visually and move across these stages as progress is made.  

Using this tool helps people keep track of their workload, monitor progress, and quickly identify what needs attention. This visibility promotes better prioritization, reduces confusion, and supports a more streamlined and efficient workflow.

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
Each column on a Kanban board represents a stage in the workflow:
- Backlog - Tasks that are planned or waiting to be started.  
- In Progress - Tasks that are actively being worked on.  
- Blocked - Tasks that are paused due to an issue, dependency, or obstacle.  
- Done - Tasks that have been completed.

These columns provide a clear snapshot of task status and help teams understand where work is concentrated.

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
Tasks move across the board from left to right as work progresses through each stage. When work begins or status changes, the task is moved to the appropriate column. Typically, the person assigned to the task is responsible for updating it to keep the board accurate and transparent. Teams may also review and update tasks together during check-ins or meetings.

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
Limiting work in progress helps teams stay focused and prevents overload. It reduces multitasking, encourages completing tasks before starting new ones, and exposes workflow bottlenecks early.

## Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban helps manage priorities by making all tasks visible and organized by status. This transparency allows me and the teams to quickly identify what needs attention and focus on the most important work first. By limiting how many tasks are worked on at the same time, Kanban prevents overload, reduces multitasking, and encourages steady progress. This structured flow helps maintain balance, ensuring work is completed efficiently without burnout.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I can improve my workflow by breaking tasks into clear, manageable stages and tracking them visually. Prioritizing work, limiting work in progress, and regularly reviewing task status help maintain focus and momentum. Kanban principles also encourage continuous improvement where I have to identify bottlennecks, adjust processes, and refine priorities over time. Therefore making my workflow more organized and manageable.

## Task

### My Kanban board:

### Improvement on task tracking:
One way I can improve task tracking in my role is by consistently updating my Kanban board in real time. Moving tasks as soon as their status changes helps me maintain an accurate view of my workload and avoid forgetting smaller tasks. This habit would make my workflow more organized and transparent, allowing me to manage responsibilities more efficiently.
