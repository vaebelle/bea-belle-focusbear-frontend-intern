### Reflection

### Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
Focus Bear seems to have started from Jeremy’s personal desire to build better habits and reduce procrastination. That personal struggle helped shape a tool designed not just for productivity, but for people who face similar challenges. Over time, it became an app that supports neurodivergent users who may struggle with managing tasks, offering structure in a way that feels understanding rather than demanding.

### What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Focus Bear addresses the everyday productivity and wellbeing challenges that many neurodivergent users experience. Instead of expecting users to fit into rigid systems, it helps them build habits and stay on track in a supportive, manageable way. The goal is to make daily tasks feel less overwhelming and more achievable.

### Why do you think this mission is important?
This mission matters because neurodivergent individuals often don’t benefit from traditional productivity approaches. Everyone deserves tools that recognize how they think and work. Creating spaces and systems that genuinely support their needs promotes inclusion and opportunity, ensuring they are supported rather than overlooked.

### How does Focus Bear's work align with your personal values or interest?
Focus Bear’s work aligns with my values because I believe productivity tools should support people in a way that feels compassionate and realistic, not pressured or one-size-fits-all. I’m interested in how technology can be designed to genuinely help people manage their daily lives, especially those who think and work differently.

### Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Personally, I also tend to procrastinate when I can't find the time to manage all my tasks. In this sense, I find Focus Bear a great tool to manage my tasks, have pomodoro timers, and setting goals for the day. These are very helpful to me as someone who juggles a lot of activities. 

### Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?
Personally, I do not know anyone diagnosed with ADHD or autism. However, I do have friends who struggle to manage their tasks and gets to be easily distracted by things. Due to these problems, they encounter difficulties in the university such as missing deadlines and overlooking important agenda. With these kinds of problems, Focus Bear is a great tool to help them from their day-to-day tasks given that the application can block distractions, encourages routines, allows users to add tasks and sort them according to priority, and a space to dump their thoughts on the go.
