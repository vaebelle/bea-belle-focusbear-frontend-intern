### Reflection
#### What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Compared to the mentioned applications above, Focus Bear is different from them in a way that the application is built and designed for users with ADHD, addressing challenges such as distractions and routine inconsistency; problems common for neurodivergent users. Moreover, as I have observed, Focus bear guides users throughout morning and evening routines in real time. 

#### If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I would choose Focus Bear over competitors because of the smart break integration. Though the application urges users to focus, it also allows them to take breaks and pause from their work making this a great application.

#### What's one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn't?
None. I think that Focus Bear has the features other applications have as of the moment. 

#### Based on your research, what's one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Features are already spot on. I think that fixing current bugs and problems of the application could make this better. Moreover, improving the ui of the app (Windows application).
