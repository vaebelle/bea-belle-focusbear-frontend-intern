### Annotated Screenshots for confusing/frustrating/unclear features
Figure 1 shows the 'Add Task' feature. I noticed that after saving a task, I can edit it and add a subtask. Wouldn’t it be more convenient to include the subtask option when initially adding the task to streamline the process?

Figure 1:

Figure 2 shows morning routines habit. As of the moment, I am confused as how this feature works, such as the built in "record sleep duration", "record energy level", and "record mood rating". I am yet to further explore how these features work and how these features captures the required data.

Figure 3 shows that the Focus Bear windows application is always hovering over other apps that I am trying to access. As someone who likes to keep track of the application I am opening, I find this frustrating since I have to minimize the Focus Bear application first to get a full view of the other application I am using.

Figure 4 shows the lack of an option to sort the tasks in alphabetical or numerical order. At first, I found it confusing as to how the tasks were being sorted, but then I realized it was according to its top priority score. I love the idea, however, often times I want to sort my tasks in numerical order. It would be a good addition.

Figure 5 shows that I filtered the task according to its status. However, it made me confuse as to why there are no tasks with "completed" status where in fact I completed some tasks as I was testing the application.

### How the onboarding experience could be improved:
