### Which extensions did you install and why?
1. React Developer Tool - I installed this extension because it helps me in debugging by providing me insights on how components are structured and how data flows through the app.

2. Redux DevTools - I installed this extension because it allows me to monitor the state changes of my developing applications. 

 3. JSON Viewer - I installed this extension because it validates and makes JSON documents easy to read. 

4. Lighthouse - I installed this extension since this is a useful automated tool in improving the performance, quality, and correctness of my developing applications. 


### Most Useful Thing I Learned
Development tools are useful in guiding developers in the development stages of an application. It eases workload and guides them in debugging, analysis, and provided in-depth understanding.
