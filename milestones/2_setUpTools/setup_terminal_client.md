# Setting up Terminal Client

## Task

### Set up terminal Client [done]
I have already set my terminal client. Currently using Windows Terminal+Powershell

### Customized it if desired [done]
I have already used omyzsh plugins and themes.

### Which terminal client did you use and why?
I have been using the Windows terminal / Powershell because it was the first terminal I used during my academic years and I grew comfortable using it through the years.

### What customizations did you make?
I have been introduced to omyzsh to customize my terminal. Using this, I customized the themes and added plugins for auto-suggestions and syntax highlighting.

### What was the most useful command you learned today?
I have been using the terminal for quite a long time already and found that I have still things to learn. Today, I found out about git aliases which I find very useful since they can save time and simplify my frequently used Git commands.
