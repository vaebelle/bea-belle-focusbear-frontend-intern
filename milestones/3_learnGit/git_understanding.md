## Reflections

### Why are PRs important in a team workflow?
Pull requests (PRs) are important because they create a structured way for team members to review changes before they are merged. This would avoid merging codes that are still faulty into the main branch. 

### What makes a well-structured PR?
A well-structured PR is contains descriptive title and descriptive details of the different modifications in the code. It must me clear and focused for easy review and correct documentation. 

### What did you learn from reviewing an open-source PR?
Reviewing an open-source PR showed me how important clarity and communication are in collaborative coding. I learned how developers justify their decisions, document their changes, and respond to feedback.
