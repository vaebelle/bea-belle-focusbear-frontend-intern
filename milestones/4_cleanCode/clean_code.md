# Writing Unit Tests for Clean Code

## Research

### Importance of unit testing in software development

Unit testing is a vital process in order to ensure code quality and reliability. It involves rigorous testing that helps identify bugs and errors early on.

## Task

1. Choose a testing framework

   For this test, I utilized Jest.

2. Write a few unit tests

   I created a test file as shown in the image below or refer to mathOp.js and mathOp.test.js files:

   ![alt text](docs/image.png)
   ![alt text](docs/image_2.png)

   I tried running the test and it shows that my code works based on the tests deployed.

## Reflection

### How do unit tests help keep code clean

Unit tests help keep code clean by:

1. Encouraging modular design: Writing testable code naturally leads to smaller, focused functions with single responsibilities
2. Documenting behavior: Tests serve as living documentation showing how functions should be used and what they should return
3. Preventing regressions: Tests catch bugs early when refactoring or adding features, ensuring code remains clean and functional
4. Enforcing good practices: The need to write tests pushes developers to avoid code smells like tight coupling and unclear naming
5. Building confidence: With tests in place, developers can refactor and improve code quality without fear of breaking functionality

### What issues did you find while testing

None.
